<h4> Who are always with tight Budget </center><br>

<center><h3 style="color:purple;">
<li>1. Clear pricing without hidden fees Nothing makes a visitor bounce quicker than unexpected charges and taxes.<br> 
Despite its insistent, upselling tactics, EasyJet is clear about its pricing throughout the customer
 journey.<br><br>
<li>2. Google map integration .It’s helpful to see available holidays laid out on a map, especially one that’s fully<br> interactive and 
lets you see the details of the destination selected with an arresting image.<br><br>
<li>3. Simple checkout
Finally let’s go back to Graham Charlton and his post on Airbnb…Creating a great user<br> experience is wasted if your <br>checkout contains various barriers to purchase<br>
 and travel sites do have a habit of over-complicating checkout.<br><br>
<li>4. Tourism and travel-related services include services provided by hotels and restaurants , travel agencies and <br>tour operator services, tourist guide services and other related services.<br>
A crucial aspect of trade in tourism services is the cross-border movement of consumers .<br><br>
<li>5. This permits a variety of workers, including those in remote areas, to become services exporters for instance,
 <br>by guiding tourists, performing in local events, or working in tourist accommodation.<br><br>
 <li>6. While digitalisation offers great potential for many aspects of tourism services, the sector continues to<br>
 depend highly on the cross-border movement of both customers and<br>
 employees, and remains strongly linked to transport services</h3><br><br></center>
